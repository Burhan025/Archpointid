In this project, I have customized a WordPress site by adding custom sidebars, post types (Doctors, Services, Testimonials, Offices), and fields using CMB2. Also added dynamic menus, and adjusted the admin interface. I created custom templates, banners, and responsive layouts, and integrated multimedia features.
